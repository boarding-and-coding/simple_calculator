# Building a Node.js Calculator App with HTML UI

## 1. Setting Up the Node.js Environment

Install Node.js: Download and install Node.js from the official website.

Create a Project Directory:

bash
Copy code
mkdir simple-calculator
cd simple-calculator
Initialize npm:

bash
Copy code
npm init -y

## 2. Creating the Node.js Calculator App with HTML UI

Create index.js:
This is your main server file. Include the necessary code to create a basic web server and define the /calculate endpoint for your calculator operations.

Install Express:

bash
Copy code
npm install express
Create index.html:
This file will contain the HTML structure for your calculator UI. Include inputs for numbers, buttons for operations, and a script to handle button clicks and make requests to your server.

## 3. Containerizing the Application

Create a Dockerfile:
This file is used to build a Docker container for your app.
Dockerfile
Copy code
FROM node:14
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "index.js"]

## 4. Testing the Application Locally

Run Node.js Server:

bash
Copy code
node index.js
Test the application by accessing http://localhost:3000 in a web browser and using curl to test the API.

Testing with Docker:

Build the Docker image:
bash
Copy code
docker build -t my-calculator-app .
Run the Docker container:
bash
Copy code
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-calculator-app
Access http://localhost:3000 to interact with the application running inside the Docker container.

## 5. Creating a GitHub Repository and Pushing the Code

Initialize Git Repository:
In your project directory:

bash
Copy code
git init
Create a .gitignore File:
Include node_modules/ and other files/directories you don't want to track.

Add Files to Git:

bash
Copy code
git add .
Commit Files:

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Create a New Repository on GitHub:

Go to GitHub, sign in, and create a new repository.
Add GitHub Repository as Remote:
Replace YOUR-REPOSITORY-URL with your GitHub repository URL.

bash
Copy code
git remote add origin YOUR-REPOSITORY-URL
Push to GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git push -u origin master
Additional Notes
Customize your app by adding more features or improving the UI.
Make sure to test each part thoroughly after development.
Regularly commit your changes to GitHub to keep track of your project's progress.
This guide provides a comprehensive overview of creating a basic calculator app with Node.js, deploying it using Docker, and managing your code with Git and GitHub.
